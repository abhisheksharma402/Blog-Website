Her father refused to let her come out at Court, she has, since his death and her elder brother’s enrolment in the army, been keeping house with her younger brother and managing the affairs of Undershaw, the family home. And then into her life gallops Jasper Damerel, lord of the nearby Priory. With a reputation as a ne’er do well and cad, he is rumoured to have squandered his fortune and left a trail of broken hearts, and broken women behind him. In him Venetia sees the future has possibilities. But will that future be hers?</p>\n\n<p>I had heard many people over the years say how much they loved Georgette Heyer’s work. I’d seen discussions over which book was best and various suggestions of where to start. After seeing so much talk I knew I had to pick up one of her books. It was just which one. Seeing the description of Venetia, and being a Yorkshire resident, I knew this was the one to start with.</p>\n\n<p>Venetia is a lovely character. Kind, considerate of her family and her staff, she is not afraid to show her own mind. She is aware of her brothers character flaws but geninely adores Aubrey, her younger brother. She deals with conflicts between the staff with the manner of a well used mediator and she is content enough in her life in the country. Aware she will either have to marry Edward Yardley or remain a spinster aunt to her elder brother’s yet to be conceived children she hopes for a third way out by keeping house with Aubrey. Then she meets Jasper Damerel and those plans are abandoned. She finds herself a friend in Jasper, someone who challenges her but perhaps reflects some of her own dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Jasper Damerel is a rake. He’s a cad and a bounder and the mere turn of his gaze upon a young lady is enough to damage her reputation for life. Or at least that is the rumour that goes around the neighbourhood. (Though really I blame his parents. With a name like Jasper Damerel he was bound to turn out as rake). He does however find something in Venetia that was lacking in his life before. He is of course charmed by her, but he is determined that she should not have her reputation, or her life, ruined by a connection to him.</p>\n\n<p>The book looks at the role of women in society and in relationships. Venetia is frowned upon because she proposes to keep house by herself, or at least with her brother Aubrey. It was unheard of and looked upon with disdain that such expressions of independence were uttered. She is expected to either marry or to remain in her family home once her elder brother marries. Venetia wishes to marry for love, or at least not marry the only two men who pay her attention; the staid Edward and the impetuous Oswald. Divorce is tantamount to a deadly sin. Damerel gained his reputation by running away with a married woman but it was she that was forever tainted. Refused a divorce by her husband she had to wait until his death to marry again. Infidelity in women was never forgiven, whereas it was expected in men. Lady Denny, Venetia’s friend, is more than aware that her husband has had affairs and sees it as her lot as a wife to accept that. Were it the other way around that she would have been shunned from society.</p>\n\n<p>Heyer gently pokes fun at the staid world of the Regency era and shows how the role of women would eventually be able to change. Venetia has in her the seeds of female empowerment and she sows them carefully and surreptitiously, the only way she can.</p>\n\n<p>I was asked to describe her work whilst I was part way through Venetia. The best I could come up with was Jane Austen fan fiction with an edge. The writing has all there is to love about Austen, the world at the time and also a lightness, a playfulness that seems to hint that Heyer was also very much making her own mark and not merely trying to emulate another author. (There are also very Austen like references. Denny being one of the militia in Pride and Prejudice, Undershaw being very similar, to me at any rate, to Uppercross (Persuasion) another).</p>\n\n<p>The feeling I had from picking up the book to turning the last page was how much fun it was and how much fun I was having reading it. Heyer no doubt had fun writing it and I can see why legions of loyal readers want to spend hours in her world.</p>\n\n<p>I loved my first foray into the world of Georgette Heyer.  It was a pleasure to curl up with Venetia and get lost in her story. Yes, I know I should have listened to the people telling me to read her sooner. The good thing is, I have the rest of her books still to discover. I’ve feeling I’m going to enjoy my Heyer journey.</p>\n\n<p>Recommended.</p>\n\n<p>About the Author</p>\n\n<p>Author of over fifty books, Georgette Heyer is the best-known and best-loved of all historical novelists, who made the Regency period her own. Her first novel, The Black Moth, published in 1921, was written at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; her last was My Lord John. Although most famous for her historical novels, she also wrote eleven detective stories. Georgette Heyer died in 1974 at the age of seventy-one.</p>', '2017-06-04'),

As visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done, the director’s ninth feature also proves more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies, touching on such eternal themes as the sacrifices parents make for their children (and vice versa) and the world we will leave for the next generation to inherit. An enormous undertaking that, like all the director’s best work, manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal, “Interstellar” reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside “The Wizard of Oz,” “2001,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “Gravity” in the canon of Hollywood’s visionary sci-fi head trips. Global box office returns should prove suitably rocket-powered.</p>\n\n<p>We begin somewhere in the American farm belt, which Nolan evokes for its full mythic grandeur — blazing sunlight, towering corn stalks, whirring combines. But it soon becomes clear that this would-be field of dreams is something closer to a nightmare. The date is an unspecified point in the near future, close enough to look and feel like tomorrow, yet far enough for a number of radical changes to have taken hold in society. A decade on from a period of widespread famine, the world’s armies have been disbanded and the cutting-edge technocracies of the early 21st century have regressed into more utilitarian, farm-based economies.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re a caretaker generation,” notes one such homesteader (John Lithgow) to his widower son-in-law, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot who hasn’t stopped dreaming of flight, for himself and for his children: 15-year-old son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), the latter a precocious tot first seen getting suspended from school for daring to suggest that the Apollo space missions actually happened. “We used to look up in the sky and wonder about our place in the stars,” Cooper muses. “Now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt.”</p>\n\n<p>And oh, what dirt! As “Interstellar” opens, the world — or at least Cooper’s Steinbeckian corner of it — sits on the cusp of a second Dust Bowl, ravaged by an epidemic of crop blight, a silt-like haze hanging permanently in the air. (Some of this scene-setting is accomplished via pseudo-documentary interviews with the elderly residents of some more distant future reflecting on their hardscrabble childhoods, which Nolan films like the “witness” segments from Warren Beatty’s “Reds.”) And as the crops die, so the Earth’s atmosphere becomes richer in nitrogen and poorer in oxygen, until the time when global starvation will give way to global asphyxiation.</p>\n\n<p>But all hope is not lost. NASA (whose massive real-life budget cuts lend the movie added immediacy) still exists in this agrarian dystopia, but it’s gone off the grid, far from the microscope of public opinion. There, the brilliant physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine, forever the face of avuncular wisdom in Nolan’s films) and his dedicated team have devised two scenarios for saving mankind. Both plans involve abandoning Earth and starting over on a new, life-sustaining planet, but only one includes taking Earth’s current 6-billion-plus population along for the ride. Doing the latter, it seems, depends on Brand’s ability to solve an epic math problem that would explain how such a large-capacity vessel could surmount Earth’s gravitational forces. (Never discussed in this egalitarian society: a scenario in which only the privileged few could escape, a la the decadent bourgeoisie of Neill Blomkamp’s “Elysium.”)</p>\n\n<p>Many years earlier, Brand informs, a mysterious space-time rift (or wormhole) appeared in the vicinity of Saturn, seemingly placed there, like the monoliths of “2001,” by some higher intelligence. On the other side: another galaxy containing a dozen planets that might be fit for human habitation. In the wake of the food wars, a team of intrepid NASA scientists traveled there in search of solutions. Now, a decade later (in Earth years, that is), Brand has organized another mission to check up on the three planets that seem the most promising for human settlement. And to pilot the ship, he needs Cooper, an instinctive flight jockey in the Chuck Yeager mode, much as McConaughey’s laconic, effortlessly self-assured performance recalls Sam Shepard’s as Yeager in “The Right Stuff” (another obvious “Interstellar” touchstone).</p>\n\n<p>Already by this point — and we have not yet left the Earth’s surface — “Interstellar” (which Nolan co-wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator, Jonathan) has hurled a fair amount of theoretical physics at the audience, including discussions of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space. And, as with the twisty chronologies and unreliable narrators of his earlier films, Nolan trusts in the audience’s ability to get the gist and follow along, even if it doesn’t glean every last nuance on a first viewing. It’s hard to think of a mainstream Hollywood film that has so successfully translated complex mathematical and scientific ideas to a lay audience (though Shane Carruth’s ingenious 2004 Sundance winner “Primer” — another movie concerned with overcoming the problem of gravity — tried something similar on a micro-budget indie scale), or done so in more vivid, immediate human terms. (Some credit for this is doubtless owed to the veteran CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, who consulted with the Nolans on the script and receives an executive producer credit.)</p>\n\n<p>The mission itself is a relatively intimate affair, comprised of Cooper, Brand’s own scientist daughter (Anne Hathaway), two other researchers (Wes Bentley and the excellent David Gyasi) and a chatty, sarcastic, ex-military security robot called TARS (brilliantly voiced by Bill Irwin in a sly nod to Douglas Rain’s iconic HAL 9000), which looks like a walking easel but proves surprisingly agile when the going gets tough. And from there, “Interstellar” has so many wonderful surprises in store — from casting choices to narrative twists and reversals — that the less said about it the better. (Indeed, if you really don’t want to know anything more, read no further.)</p>\n\n<p>It gives nothing away, however, to say that Nolan maps his infinite celestial landscape as majestically as he did the continent-hopping earthbound ones of “The Prestige” and “Batman Begins,” or the multi-tiered memory maze of “Inception.” The imagery, modeled by Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema on Imax documentaries like “Space Station” and “Hubble 3D,” suggests a boundless inky blackness punctuated by ravishing bursts of light, the tiny spaceship Endurance gleaming like a diamond against Saturn’s great, gaseous rings, then ricocheting like a pinball through the wormhole’s shimmering plasmic vortex.\n\n<p>With each stop the Endurance makes, Nolan envisions yet another new world: one planet a watery expanse with waves that make Waimea Bay look like a giant bathtub; another an ice climber’s playground of frozen tundra and sheer-faced descents. Moreover, outer space allows Nolan to bend and twist his favorite subject — time — into remarkable new permutations. Where most prior Nolan protagonists were forever grasping at an irretrievable past, the crew of the Endurance races against a ticking clock that happens to tick differently depending on your particular vantage. New worlds mean new gravitational forces, so that for every hour spent on a given planet’s surface, years or even entire decades may be passing back on Earth. (Time as a flat circle, indeed.)</p>\n\n<p>This leads to an extraordinary mid-film emotional climax in which Cooper and Brand return from one such expedition to discover that 23 earth years have passed in the blink of an eye, represented by two decades’ worth of stockpiled video messages from loved ones, including the now-adult Tom (a bearded, brooding Casey Affleck) and Murphy (Jessica Chastain in dogged, persistent “Zero Dark Thirty” mode). It’s a scene Nolan stages mostly in closeup on McConaughey, and the actor plays it beautifully, his face a quicksilver mask of joy, regret and unbearable grief.</p>\n\n<p>That moment signals a shift in “Interstellar” itself from the relatively euphoric, adventurous tone of the first half toward darker, more ambiguous terrain — the human shadow areas, if you will, that are as difficult to fully glimpse as the inside of a black hole. Nolan, who has always excelled at the slow reveal, catches even the attentive viewer off guard more than once here, but never in a way that feels cheap or compromises the complex motivations of the characters.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, the movie marvels at the brave men and women throughout history who have dedicated themselves, often at great peril, to the greater good of mankind. On the other, because Nolan is a psychological realist, he’s acutely aware of the toil such lives may take on those who choose to lead them, and that even “the best of us” (as one character is repeatedly described) might not be immune from cowardice and moral compromise. Some people lie to themselves and to their closest confidants in “Interstellar,” and Nolan understands that everyone has his reasons. Others compensate by making the most selfless of sacrifices. Perhaps the only thing trickier than quantum physics, the movie argues, is the nature of human emotion.</p>\n\n<p>Nolan stages one thrilling setpiece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie’s ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. “Do not go gentle into that good night/Rage, rage against the dying of the light,” harks the good Professor Brand at the start of the Endurance’s journey, quoting the melancholic Welshman Dylan Thomas. And yet “Interstellar” is finally a film suffused with light and boundless possibilities — those of the universe itself, of the wonder in a child’s twinkling eyes, and of movies to translate all that into spectacular picture shows like this one.</p>\n\n<p>It’s hardly surprising that “Interstellar” reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film’s lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie’s interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. Vfx supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on “Inception”) again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film’s effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabits the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Strauss-ian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), “Interstellar” begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.</p>', '2014-10-27'),

Shirley Jackson’s 1959 novel of a decrepit, rotting mansion populated by things that go bump in the night (and in the psyche) is considered by many to be the ne plus ultra of possessed-dwelling tales. The Guardian named it “the definitive haunted house story”; The New York Times declared that it had “the greatest opening paragraph in the history of horror”; no less than Stephen King, a man who knows a thing or two about the allure of paranormal activity with an appreciation for property value, said it featured “the finest character to come out of [the] new American gothic tradition.” He was talking about Eleanor Vance, one of several “assistants” handpicked by a doctor to study specters roaming the house’s hallways and bedchambers. He could have been referring to Hill House as well — less four walls and a roof than a villain that’s “not sane … holding darkness within.” This is not anthropomorphizing a place. This is establishing your true protagonist.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the source material for Robert Wise’s The Haunting, a 1963 movie that’s Greatest-of-All-Time canon fodder for those who take horror films very seriously (out of a sense of charity and good will towards our fellow man, we’ll never speak of the 1999 big-screen adaptation again). It may or may not have helped inspire the name of The House on Haunted Hill, a ballyhoo-filled Vincent Price vehicle that came out the same year as the novel; it almost assuredly cast its shadow over Richard Matheson’s 1971 novel Hell House and its 1973 British film adaptation. Regardless, the DNA of Jackson’s extraordinary ghost story can be found in virtually every modern haunted-house narrative that came after it. And now, because it is the Year of Our Lord 2018 and every recognizable property must inevitably be turned into a multiversed franchise or a multi-episode TV show, we have been given a Netflix series that takes the name of the book and runs with it. This is not your father’s Hill House, however — a sentiment that takes on new meaning once you’ve squirmed your way through all 10 hours of this left-field horror-TV hit.\n\nProduced, cowritten and directed by Mike Flanagan, one of brighter lights in the Blumhouse-of-Horror stable — check out Hush (2016) if you haven’t already — this Haunting of Hill House kicks off with a voiceover of Jackson’s much-lauded opening paragraph. It then proceeds to renovate the narrative substantially, retaining names and characteristics but rejiggering everything else. Hugh Crain, the man said to have built this cursed estate, is now merely its new owner. He’s moving his family in while he spruces things up in the hopes of flipping it for a profit. What were once a team of “researchers” are now his kids: Theodora (Kate Siegel) is still a glove-wearing sapphic psychic, but she’s also a Crain; ditto Luke (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), the book’s resident fuck-up (“Luke … was a liar. He was also a thief”) who gets to add “heroin addict” to his list of less desirable qualities. Luke’s twin, Nell (Victoria Pedretti) is assigned Eleanor’s role as the house’s obscure object of desire.* Also on hand are the matriarch-going-mad Olivia Crain (Carla Gugino); true-horror novelist son Steven Crain (Michael Huisman); and the mortician daughter Shirley Crain (Elizabeth Reaser). Yes, she’s the ambassador between the worlds of corporeal and spiritual death. No, her first name is not a coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>We also get the Dudleys, the book’s mildly eccentric married caretakers who both seem as if they are seconds away from asking the new residents if they want to have a potato. And we get Hill House, the real estate deal of the damned that subsists on legacies of rage and resentment. This is what it needs from the Crains when they take up residence in 1992, and why it gives the family a “red room”: a malleable, ever-changeable space that rests at the mansion’s dead center. The true purpose lurking within that permanently locked study, the one with shadows visible beneath the door, is not revealed until the show’s final 20 minutes. It only takes a hour, possibly two, of ping-ponging between dual timelines — flashback mode and present-day mode — to get a sense of what’s really going on here. This is not just a horror series. It’s after slightly bigger game.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, viewers should come for the requisite jump scares and various bits of creepy business. Bugs crawling out of mouths, corpses stiffly rising from slabs, spirits that go from pretty young things to withered old crones, unexpectedly gaping mouths and melting faces — all present and accounted for. Spooky figures have a habit of being one place when a moving camera first catches them, then suddenly appear to be much, much closer when the shot turns back to reframe them. Two of the more distinguishable ghosts, a J-horror–chic woman known as “The Bent-Neck Lady” and a lanky floating ghoul with a cane, are genuinely unsettling. Pregnant women may want to skip the final installment; people with bum tickers may want to bypass the series’ back half entirely.</p>\n\n<p>But the inventory of tried-and-true horror tropes are being used to more sinister ends than just the art of the “Boo!” As a genre exercise, The Haunting of Hill House is a better-than-decent stab at a supernatural story, the equivalent of a well-executed if slightly overlong bass solo. As a tale of what happens when the ties that bind are the same ones that gag you, and scar you, and occasionally strangle you to death, it’s absolutely terrifying.</p>\n\n<p>And it’s that aspect, the way that it keeps returning to how shared histories, blood relations and familial traumas have a habit of forever marking folks, that makes the show strike a nerve. No one knows your weak spots and pressure points better than your kin, unless maybe it’s a house that’s using your memories to infect you and possess you. But the Crain clan’s antagonistic relationship with each other is what keeps rotating them around the cursed residence like planets around a sun. It’s the ground zero for their collective derailing. Even the grown-up versions’ pair-ups can’t let go of old inter-clique grudges. Yet Theo’s inability to sustain relationships, Steven’s exploitation of family tragedies in a desperate need for success, Nell’s grief-fueled gradual mental collapse, Shirley’s superiority complex, the monkey on Luke’s back that’s made him persona non grata — Hill House did not cause these things. It merely exacerbated such wounds. The place did drive their mother mad, which ended in her death. Their father’s inability to cope with the loss, as well as his part in their abandonment issues and subsequent alienation from his offspring, however? That’s all dad. (Playing the young Hugh, Henry Thomas lets folks see the character’s protective shell chip away piece by piece. Then Timothy Hutton takes over and turns the patriarch into a pile of shattered glass. It’s a nice double act.)<p>\n\n<p>In fact, it’s that old saw about the past never being done with you — always a given when it comes to your family — that turns the wheels of the show’s two major standout episodes. The fifth installment, “The Bent-Neck Lady,” gives us the backstory of the lank-haired, crooked-headed ghost that’s plagued Nell since she was small and plays into her eventual demise, sick-joke-style; it’s both heartbreaking and suggestive of an endless feedback-loop nightmare. (If this Hill House knows how to do anything well, it’s replicate the rhythms of nightmares — that, and presenting horror from a kid’s warped, three-feet-high-and-rising perspective of the adult world.)</p>\n\n<p>The one that follows it, “Two Storms,” has attracted a lot of attention for its formal stylistics: The hour is made up of several long, single-shot takes, some of which are indeed unbroken and others that keep the illusion going with an ingenious invisible cut. What’s more impressive is how these virtuoso moves actually enhance the storytelling rather than eclipse it. The family have gathered together for a funeral. A storm is taking place outside. As Hugh walks into a backroom, he’s suddenly back in Hill House’s parlor, along with his wife and kids — a literal stroll into the past. A storm rages outside of that house as well, one that ends up bearing a resemblance to a “rain of stones” mentioned in Jackson’s book. That one doesn’t end well either. Two violent phenomena, seamlessly blending into one another. One parent and his children, all bound together by common ground and catastrophe.</p>', '2018-10-23'),

Is that a little too simplistic? Perhaps, but when a storyline includes odd goings-on at a mysterious government facility in a small town, the disappearance of a child and huge dollops of 80s nostalgia, it’s hard to argue with. Still, it’s clear that Winden, the small southern German town where the action is set, is no Hawkins. From the first moments of the show, when a deep, gravelly voice talks about time travel and we witness a suicide, it’s obvious that this is something rather more adult.\r\n\r\nJonas – the main character and son of Daniel Kahnwald, the man who took his own life – is struggling to cope with his father’s death and fit back into an everyday routine in the small, myopic community. Things only get more complicated when, during a late-night mission to unearth some hidden weed stashed by a friend who has been missing for a week, he’s the last person to see Mikkel Nielsen, who has apparently vanished into thin air as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat inscrutable voiceover starts to make more sense when it is revealed that Mikkel has managed to make his way to 1986. Far from being the moment Dark’s creator, Baran bo Odar, jumps the shark, the switch back to the mid 80s is when Dark really gets interesting. There’s no  for Mikkel, though, who returns to his house only to find an angsty, thrash metal-loving version of his father (Ulrich), who has little interest in helping out a lost child, even though his own brother disappeared a few months earlier. The 1986 version of his mother isn’t any more sympathetic, so it’s left to the town’s police chief and a lonely nurse to look after him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the disappearances, things begin to go awry in modern-day Winden, too. Sheep are dying during the night, old men are wandering into town hall meetings and mumbling nonsense, and everyone is slowly understanding that this just might have something to do with an almost identical case two decades earlier. The action is actually split between three time zones – modern day, 1986 and 1953. It’s a whodunnit, combined with a who did it (back then), that’s knotty without getting incomprehensible. As things progress, the connections between the different eras and families of Winden start to reveal themselves, and the motive of the show’s villain – who seems bent on torturing children with 80s German television and Euro-pop – begins to emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere aren’t many missteps in Dark. The super slo-motion anguished screams of Ulrich look as if they were copy-and-pasted from a daytime soap, but everything else is tuned into the show’s dense and foreboding frequency. The similarities to Stranger Things are, in truth, a distraction from Dark’s own quality, although it might have made more sense to tone down the echoes of Netflix’s other disappearing child show so that it could stand on its own. But for fans of slow-burners, such as Les Revenants, this will fill a noirish hole and bring a bit of classy obsidian darkness to the yuletide binge schedule.', '2017-12-01'),

(14, 6, 'Digital Fortress - review', 'From an electrifying new voice in suspense fiction', 'From an electrifying new voice in suspense fiction comes Digital Fortress, a lightning-paced thriller that U.S. intelligence analysts are calling “utterly plausible.”\r\n\r\nChillingly current and filled with more intelligence secrets than Tom Clancy, Digital Fortress transports the reader deep within the most powerful intelligence organization on earth–the National Security Agency (NSA)–an ultra-secret, multi-billion dollar agency which (until now) less than three percent of Americans knew existed.\r\n\r\nWhen the NSA’s most classified technological wonder–an invincible code-breaking machine–encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls in its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power.\r\n\r\nThe NSA is being held hostage… not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it will cripple U.S. intelligence.\r\n\r\nCaught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides she finds herself fighting not only for her country, but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.\r\n\r\nWith a startling twist that leaves the agency scrambling to avert the biggest intelligence disaster in U.S. history, Digital Fortress never lets up. From the underground hallways of power, to the skyscrapers of Tokyo, to the towering cathedrals of Spain, a desperate race unfolds.\r\n\r\nIt is a battle for survival — a crucial bid to destroy a creation of inconceivable genius… an impregnable code-writing formula that threatens to obliterate the balance of power. Forever.', '2021-06-26'),

Hypotheses go wrong, experiments do not deliver the expected outcomes. There are contaminations, misleadingly simplistic or representative models, false-positive results, experiments without controls, rejections of manuscripts, and failed projects. The actual reason, why science is so successful, is all these failures. It is, therefore, imperative to learn the real value of mistakes.\r\n\r\n“Failures are a sign that you are inventing,” says Elon Musk. Curiosity guides us to learn better and faster. We have been taught to attach connotations to words and are accustomed to believing that success is positive, and failures are negative. However, learnings are never black and white – they are a full rainbow. Each colour is an experience that must be enjoyed, lived, and felt.\r\n\r\nScientists hardly speak of false starts. There is nothing glamorous about dead and failed stories. And so there is a big chunk of knowledge that goes unreported or unpublished.\r\n\r\nHow do scientists cope with recurrent failures and grow? In my own research journey, many times I wish I knew about earlier false starts so that it didn’t have to go down an already failed path. I did not find any resource where scientists shared their wisdom from failures. Therefore, I started FailWise to offer learnings, information, opinion, and guidance around such failures. The inspiration came from Brandon Mull’s words: “Smart people learn from their mistakes, but the real sharp ones learn from the mistakes of others.”\r\n\r\nEvery scientist has a personal relationship with failures, and evolves uniquely. I have too. As a biology undergraduate, I learnt a big lesson early on when my lecturer published under his name all data from a research project I was working on to get a grant. Similarly, a lab mate presented my data without my consent or acknowledgment to get a postdoc position. Lesson I learnt: don’t disclose all your data and research to anyone. Never circulate your lab reports or critical data even among close friends.', '2021-06-26'),

DOD takes reports of incursions – by any aerial object, identified or unidentified – very seriously, and investigates each one.\r\n\r\nThe report submitted today highlights the challenges associated with assessing UAP occurring on or near DOD training ranges and installations.  The report also identified the need to make improvements in processes, policies, technologies, and training to improve our ability to understand UAP.\r\n\r\nTo that end, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks today directed the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security to develop a plan to formalize the mission currently performed by the UAPTF.\r\n\r\nThis plan will be developed in coordination with various DOD components, including the military departments and the combatant commands, and with ODNI and other interagency partners.  The plan will establish procedures for synchronizing collection, reporting and analysis of UAP; provide recommendations for securing military test and training ranges; and identify requirements for the establishment and operation of a new follow-on DOD activity to lead the effort, including its alignment, resources, staffing, authorities, and a timeline for implementation.', '2021-06-26'),
